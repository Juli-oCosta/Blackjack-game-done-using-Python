# Blackjack-game-done-using-Python
I wanted to spend time while also studying codding something, went up with the ideia to do a cards game in pyton, said game being blackjack.

It's not done yet, if you end up wanting to use improve it, or use it as reference, feel free to do so, I let osme comments here and there with possible changes and some explaining. 

Done using Visual Studio Code, if it is of any help.
