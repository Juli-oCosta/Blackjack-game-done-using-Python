# Blackjack
I wanted to spend time while also studying some codding, went up with the ideia to do a cards game in pyton, said game being blackjack.

It's not done yet, if you end up wanting to improve it, or use it as reference, feel free to do so, I left some comments here and there with possible changes and some explaining. 

Firstly done using Pycharm and now Visual Studio Code, if it is of any help.
